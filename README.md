The objective of this portion is quantitative prediction. In this project, we will explore four approaches to supervised maching learning. The first modeling choices we make are to use regression instead of classification to include more flexible models at the expense of interpretability. As we deal with count data, we will use a poisson distribution. We will compare the outcomes of the following models:

1.Random gorest using ‘ranger’
2.Generalized linear model using ‘glm’
3.Stochastic gradient boosting using ‘gbm’
4.Cubist using ‘cubist’
